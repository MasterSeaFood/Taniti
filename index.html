            <h1>Welcome to Taniti</h1>
            <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
                miles, the
                terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical
                rainforests, and a
                mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
                20,000. Until a
                recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
